        MY RESPONSIBILITIES

      <div class="TSJContent">
        <h2>Create a Level</h2>
        <p>I had a lot of freedom when creating the level and with no prior experience, there was a lot of trial and error. My vision for the Silver Island encompassed distinct points of interest, including the village, igloos, a village extension, the house at the final objective, and a non-goal-oriented lookout point. I utilized tiled assets to arrange these areas, while the houses and background were crafted by hand.</p>
        <h2>Develop Mochi; The Main Character</h2>
        <p>For the player character I not only had to develop the functionality, but also the art assets. I not only created basic functions such as walking, interacting, attacking, but I also implemented systems like health and economy that have their own scripts. All of the systems had different scripts that were attached to the player. I also created walk and idle animations using Aseprite and implemented them using a state machine.</p>

        <h2>Develop the Penguin Locals (NPCs)</h2>
        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the creative process of designing penguin NPCs, each featuring unique sprites and dialogues, serving as guides for the player's journey. To implement them efficiently, I utilized a parent NPC script as the foundation, generating children scripts with individual details. The parent script handled core functionalities like interaction, displaying the dialogue box, and assigning quests, while the children scripts incorporated specific elements such as sprites, dialogues, and quests for each NPC.</p>
        <h2>Develop the Slime Enemy</h2>
        <p>In creating a challenge, I went for an enemy that presents a threat to the player without causing repeated deaths. The slime enemy, designed with 2 health points, only inflicts damage when the player gets too close. The script includes functions for tracking the player, triggering an attack on collision, and initiating an on death function that randomly spawns a coin, heart, or nothing.</p>

        <h2>Develop the User Interface</h2>
        <p>I maintained a straightforward UI design, including the main and pause menus, the HUD, win and lose screens, and the end screen. This setup ensures that players receive essential information during the game and can easily pause or conclude a session at any time. Scenes with buttons were used to construct the UI menus.</p>
        <h2>Develop a Quest & Dialogue System</h2>
        <p>This was really fun for me because I got to create missions encouraging players to venture out and explore. Each system has its dedicated scripts and UI. The dialogue box features the NPC's name and picture, fostering player familiarity with the locals.</p>

        <h2>Create Pixel Art Assets</h2>
        <p>Using Aseprite, I created a multitude of assets encompassing environmental elements (background, houses, paths) and characters (NPCs and player). I immersed myself in pixel art tutorials and references, so I could learn the techniques that allowed me to create a satisfactory product in the end.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Create a Story</h2>
        <p>The story underwent early development and went through several iterations. I aimed to incorporate a sense of mystery, with one of the main character's friends going missing, providing the player with a clear goal at the beginning of the game. This setup encourages players to embark on quests that drive them to explore and advance the narrative. Dialogue writing took place later in development, and I made several adjustments based on playtesting to ensure that players receive sufficient information about the ongoing quest.</p>

      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>My primary accomplishment was crafting this game within approximately 5 months, despite lacking prior experience except for a few courses on C# and Unity Basics. I take immense pride in this achievement as it signifies my start into game development. Despite encountering numerous challenges, such as bugs and implementation errors leading to project breakdowns, I consistently overcame these obstacles and persisted in the development process. The successful implementation of the quest and dialogue system marked one of my most significant accomplishments, as it was a complex script that played a key role in the project.</p>
