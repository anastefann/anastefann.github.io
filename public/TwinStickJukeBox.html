        MY RESPONSIBILITIES

      <div class="TSJContent">
        <h2>Developed The Bombee Enemy</h2>
        <p>I created an enemy inspired by Minecraft's creeper, designed to follow and explode near the player, with the blast serving as a means to generate more in-game currency (honey). This explosive enemy contributes to a faster player progression through power-ups, fostering a sense of empowerment. The implementation involves a simple function to track the player and a collision detection mechanism, triggering an explosion if the player remains within a radius for 1.5 seconds, leading to the elimination of nearby enemies through signals.</p>
        <h2>Developed The Knives Weapon</h2>
        <p>The weapon is a projectile that does 1 damage, utilizing inspiration from Vampire Survivors. The simplicity of the weapon allowed me to use power-ups to make it more intricate, such as "piercing bullets" or "extra knife projectile". This is so that the intended player experience can be achieved through upgrading the weapon. To implement it, I spawn a knife projectile every second in the direction that the player is facing in, which has a base health of 1. Upon upgrading "piercing bullets", the health is increased by 1, which allows it to pass through one more enemy.</p>

      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Developed The Survival Game Mode</h2>
        <p>The game mode I chose is survival and it implies staying alive for as long as possible in the given 10 minutes, ensuring the game does not continue forever. The goal is to get the highest score, which is determined by the amount of enemies killed. I made use of signals again for the score, increasing it by one every time an enemy dies.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Developed The Power-Up System</h2>
        <p>The power-up system also gets a lot of inspiration from Vampire Survivors. When the player collects enough honey, they will level up and be met with 3 upgrade choices. The whole point of this system is to give the player the decision in what they want to power-up while they become more and more powerful, so they start feeling more in control. Implementation wise, I got to create a power-up manager script that held all the power-up functionality. I used functions that take care of the processes such as selecting 3 different random power-ups on level up, handling player input, handling the UI, and more.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>I quickly acquired proficiency in working with a new engine and coding in GDScript. Despite being familiar with logical structures, adapting to this language was necessary for effectively implementing the systems I designed. The switch from Unreal Engine blueprints to scripting was refreshing, allowing efficient implementation of key elements (enemy, weapon, game mode) within the first three weeks. The implementation of the power-up system initially posed challenges. Through iteration and patience, I successfully developed an intricate script, marking a substantial accomplishment within the project, as I had achieved my stretch goal. Creating a power-up system for enhanced gameplay, I faced challenges in selecting impactful abilities but refined eight distinct power-ups through extensive playtesting.</p>
