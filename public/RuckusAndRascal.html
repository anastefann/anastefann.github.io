      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Set Up and Monitor Scrum & Kanban Boards in Jira</h2>
        <p>I played a central role in establishing and monitoring our Jira and Kanban boards, ensuring efficient project management. This involved creating task and bug report templates to standardize our documentation process. I organized the main game features into Epics, providing a structured overview of our project's major components. While monitoring tasks, sub-tasks, and bug reports, I maintained a keen eye on project progress and issue resolution. Additionally, I took charge of creating and managing sprints, fostering a well-organized and dynamic workflow for our development team.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Create and Update the Risk Log</h2>
        <p>I created the Risk Log during the first week of taking over the producer role. I then updated it on a bi-weekly basis, keeping track of what risks have occurred and of new ones that appeared throughout the project. This not only included the risks themselves, but also the level of severity, the impact they would have on the project, and what the mitigation plan is.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Create Pipelines & Documents for the Team</h2>
        <p>As a producer, I played a key role in establishing essential pipelines and documents to optimize the team's workflow. This included implementing a playtesting pipeline for efficient testing, a bug report pipeline for streamlined issue tracking, and customized Jira pipelines accompanied by documentation for seamless project management. Additionally, I provided the team with clear project goals through a Minimal & Target Scope Overview, and a detailed Scope Breakdown for better understanding and alignment among team members.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Took the role of Scrum Master</h2>
        <p>In my role, I hosted various Scrum rituals, including Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews, Retrospectives, Build Reviews, and Sprint Planning, ensuring the team's adherence to the agile methodology. Taking charge of the Scrum Board, I administered ticket updates and daily progress tracking. Regularly analyzing Burndown Charts, I adapted strategies to enhance team efficiency and progress for upcoming sprints, which increased by an average of 20%. Identifying and removing impediments was a key responsibility, involving the use of risk logs for mitigation planning and collaboration with discipline leads to address emerging issues. Additionally, I ensured discipline leads maintained, updated, and prioritized the backlog, crucial for effective sprint planning and overall project success.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Create Progress Presentations</h2>
        <p>I developed bi-weekly progress presentations that highlighted the game build, team objectives, priorities, roadmaps, and relevant updates. These presentations were delivered to stakeholders, and the feedback received guided our actions and improvements for the following presentation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Helped with Marketing our Game</h2>
        <p>In contributing to the marketing efforts of our game, I played a cruical role in establishing a strong online presence. This involved setting up and managing our social media accounts, ensuring effective communication with our audience. Additionally, I took charge of creating and updating our itch.io page, crafting a compelling and informative space for potential players. To enhance engagement, I created promotional assets that effectively conveyed the essence of our game. Recognizing the importance of direct interaction, I actively participated in various game events such as Night of the Nerds and Industry Showcase Day @ BUas. To keep our audience informed about the development journey and upcoming features, I regularly posted engaging devlogs, fostering a sense of community and anticipation around our game.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="TSJLeftovers">
        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>In my role as the producer for our small game project, I successfully navigated significant challenges that profoundly influenced the project's trajectory. Overcoming the absence of a dedicated level designer, our team executed a condensed level creation process through collaborative efforts, proving to be a vital lifeline for the project. Addressing a shortage of designers, we adapted our concept by streamlining the level and incorporating entertaining minigames, enhancing player engagement. While exploring production in Year 1, I discovered a preference for behind-the-scenes planning and management over spotlight involvement. In terms of marketing, I gained valuable insights into identifying target audiences, creating personas, compiling competitor and press lists, and conducting effective playtesting. The project also provided valuable lessons in writing devlogs, crafting marketing assets, and managing social media, with opportunities for improvement recognized.</p>
