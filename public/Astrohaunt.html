        MY RESPONSIBILITIES

    </div>

    <section class="TSJTopContainer">
      <div class="TSJContent">
        <h2>Developed a Saving System for High Scores & Leaderboard</h2>
        <p>The saving system served dual purposes: for the intro cutscene, played only once at the game's start, and for saving high scores. The top 10 scores, entered by players at the end of each game, were displayed in a leaderboard, which creates competition. The implementation involved using a tutorial for the saving system itself and creating a custom keyboard layout for the high score screen using buttons that once pressed would add a letter to an array. When the high score limit was reached, the system determined whether the player's score qualified for saving (if it was higher than the lowest score) or triggered the game over screen.</p>
        <h2>Developed the Top-Down Camera</h2>
        <p>For the camera, we looked at multiple options including fully top-down, isometric, and tilted top-down, which is the option we went for. I developed the camera around game feel and player feedback. We wanted it to display enough information to the player while not having it fully zoomed out. This is so that they would not get to see where the enemies are at all times, but would rather have to go look for them using items like the Ouija Board. Implementation consisted of attaching a spring arm to the player and adjusting values until we were happy with it.</p>

        <h2>Developed the Astronaut Character</h2>
        <p>For the character, I created multiple versions of how walking would feel, ranging from regular to floaty movement. After testing with players, I realized that the floaty movement makes it harder to control the character, resulting in frustrating situations, so I went with a regular feel of walking. Implementation was done by using Unreal's base character blueprint, followed by adjusting a lot of variables in the character movement component, so that I would reach the desired feel.</p>
        <h2>Developed the Controls</h2>
        <p>The interesting part here is that I implemented controller support for player input alongside one other designer. We researched what the popular controls are for games like ours for both keyboard and controller. Once we reached a consensus, we made use of the old Unreal input, where each input action was set in the project settings and used in blueprints through events.</p>

        <h2>Developed UI Menus & HUD</h2>
        <p>Using Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG), I developed many UI screens within the game, ranging from the main menu, the HUD, the leaderboard, and more. One feature I am specifically proud of was the implementation of a damage response through a vignette. This is because the players did not understand how much damage they were taking and could not always look at their health bar while playing the game. So, when the player gets hurt, a bloody vignette will appear for a short amount of time as a feedback response and gets progressively bloodier the less health the player has. Additionally, implementing controller support for all menus was a significant accomplishment for me at the time.
          <br/><br/>
          Here is all the UI I worked on: Player HUD, Pause Menu, Main Menu, Options Menu, Credits Menu, Intro Cutscene, Leaderboard & High Score Screens, Instructional Pop-Ups (For Tutorial)</p>

        <h2>Developed a Tutorial Level</h2>
        <p>Towards the end of the project, I was asked to take on the task of creating the tutorial level. I started by defining the goal of this level: introducing all the mechanics in a logical order for the player. I laid the level out through sketching, blocked it out using basic shapes in Unreal, then iterated on it multiple times based on feedback from the team and playtesters. And once that was done, I had artists set dress it, while I worked on implementing short animations that explained the game mechanics. The goal was to give the player a visual explanation of the feature before they encountered it. I used UMG animations for popping in and out the instructional cards.</p>

        <h2>Kept up with a few Producer Tasks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Created and Updated Risk Log</li>
          <li>Created Helpers for my Team (examples for Scrum Rituals)</li>
          <li>Created Templates (personal burndown chart)</li>
          <li>Explained Scrum Concepts to artists and programmers</li>
          <li>Kept Track of the Miro Board (where we had the backlog with all our tasks)</li>
          <li>Created notes during Scrum Rituals</li>

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>I actively sought out new challenges by contributing to UI and tutorial tasks, showcasing effective task management. Stepping out of my comfort zone, I improved communication skills within multidisciplinary teams, noted in positive peer reviews. Managing stress during project-end pressure, collaboration and support from artists played a crucial role in revamping the instructional cards for the tutorial level. Engaging in the production side was challenging but enjoyable, with the acquired knowledge anticipated to benefit future projects. The project highlighted the importance of team trust and collaboration, creating a more relaxed working environment through shared initiative and responsibility.</p>
